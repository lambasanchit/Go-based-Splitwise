# Go-based-Splitwise
Create a service similar to Splitwise, where users can track each expense and the amount that each person in the group owes. Users are not required to pay each bill individually; the service should allow users to sum up all of the expenses that they owe and automatically calculate the total amount owed to others in the group.
